<item step ='1'>In small bowl, combine <ingred ptr="#cumin">cumin</ingred>, <ingred ptr="#cardamom">cardamom</ingred>, <ingred ptr="#bPeppcorn">peppercorns</ingred>, <ingred ptr="#chile">chiles</ingred> and <ingred ptr="#cinnstick">cinnamon</ingred>. Preheat large skillet over medium-high heat. Once pan feels hot, add spice blend to pan.</item>
<item step ='2'>Toast spices, stirring them constantly as they bloom with nutty aroma and turn just a shade darker, 1 to 2 minutes.</item>
<item step ='3'>Quickly remove spices from pan and transfer to plate to cool, about 5 minutes. </item>
<item step ='4'>Once cooled, transfer spices to grinder, like coffee grinder, and grind to consistency of finely ground black pepper.</item> 
<item step ='5'>In food processor, place coarsely chopped <ingred ptr="#yellonion">onion</ingred>, <ingred ptr="#freshGinger">ginger</ingred>, <ingred ptr="#garlicClove">garlic</ingred> and ground spices.</item>
<item step ='6'>Mince ingredients to consistency of slightly coarse paste. </item>
<item step ='7'>In same skillet, pour <ingred ptr="#canolaO">canola oil</ingred> and heat over medium temperature. Once oil appears to shimmer, add finely chopped <ingred ptr="#yellonion">onion</ingred> and stir-fry until it turns light brown around edges, about 5 minutes.</item> 
<item step ='8'>Add <ingred ptr="#tompaste">paste</ingred> to same skillet and cook, stirring ingredients occasionally, uncovered, until moisture in paste evaporates and <ingred ptr="#canolaO">canola oil</ingred> starts to separate from mix, 5 to 8 minutes. </item>
<item step ='9'>Add <ingred ptr="#chickenBone">chicken</ingred> pieces and allow them to absorb flavors from other ingredients, turning occasionally, uncovered, until some pieces turn lightly brown, about 5 minutes. </item>
<item step ='10'>Pour in <ingred ptr="#tomSauce">tomato sauce</ingred>, sprinkle in <ingred ptr="#salt">salt</ingred> and stir well. </item>
<item step ='11'>Lower heat to medium-low and cook <ingred ptr="#chickenBone">chicken</ingred>, covered, stirring occasionally, until meat in thickest parts is no longer pink inside and juices run clear, 20 to 25 minutes. </item>
<item step ='12'>Serve <ingred ptr="#chickenBone">chicken</ingred> warm with aromatic sauce alongside a plate of rice, couscous or in the traditional way with slices of hard-boiled eggs. </item>

    <note n='1'>Cook’s Tip: Cut-up, bone-in chicken can be found in every grocery store’s meat department. These skin-on pieces are easy to work with compared to the messy process of skinning a whole chicken and cutting it into smaller pieces. To skin, hold chicken piece in one hand and with a paper towel in the other hand, pull off skin, using towel to help you grip skin. Sometimes partially freezing chicken also makes skinning easier. While pre-cut pieces make for less work, they are typically more expensive than a whole chicken.</note>

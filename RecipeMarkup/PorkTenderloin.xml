    <note n='1'>Cook’s Tips: Most supermarkets and Asian grocery stores carry a five-spice powder blend. If not, make your own by combining:
    . 1 1/2 tsp (7 mL) fennel seeds,
    . 1 1/2 tsp (7 mL) whole cloves,
    . 1 1/2 tsp (7 mL) Sichuan peppercorns (or 2 tsp/10 mL ground),
    . 6 star anise (or 2 tsp/10 mL ground) and
    . 3 3-inch (7.5-cm) long cinnamon sticks, broken into smaller pieces,
    in a spice grinder. Grind until the texture resembles that of finely ground black pepper. Some of China’s signature dishes, such as Peking duck, barbecued spare ribs and roast pork, are flavored with this classic blend. Other five-spice powders may include cardamom, cassia (instead of cinnamon), ginger, nutmeg and even licorice root.
If doubling or tripling this recipe, cook the dish in two or three separate batches to retain that wok-seared, smoky flavor. If you overcrowd the pan, the ingredients will be stewed as opposed to stir-fried and seared, and the consequence will be blah-tasting fare.</note>

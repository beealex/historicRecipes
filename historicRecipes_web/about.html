        <h2>Why did you choose this project?</h2>
        <p>I chose this project because I love everything food related, as well as history! This project for me combined both of my interests into one thing.I love seeing what recipes were used and how recipes were made in the past. I also enjoy learning about ingredients and how they are used as well as their origin! I believe that this project has shown me more about what spices do than by watching cooking shows!</p>

        <p> I chose thise project because growing up, my family would cook traditional German dishes that were passed on from my Oma who came from Germany. I have always been interested in cooking and how the trading of spices affected and developed various dishes around the world.</p>

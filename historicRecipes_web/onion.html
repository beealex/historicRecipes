        <h3>Common Name: Onion</h3>
        <h3>Genus Species:Allium cepa</h3>
        <h3>Family: Alliaceae</h3>
        <h3>Origin: Himilayas, Siberia</h3>
        <h3>Cultivation:Widely around the world</h3>
        <h3>Description: The onion probably originated in East Asia, but has spread around the world
            and has developed numerous varieties, including shallot, chive, and scallion. The name
            may come from onion’s “union” or singleness as a bulb. The plant is related to the lily
            botanically; chemically it is a less piquant cousin of garlic in taste, but it is unique
            in its lachrymatory properties. It is said to be the basis for the name of Chicago,
            which comes from an Indian phrase meaning “The place where the wild onion (or garlic)
            grows”. Currently, it is the most popular herb, since it is nutritionally satisfying in
            addition to being flavorful; people, such as the Hebrews who made their exodus from
            Egypt 3000 years ago, have long favored it as a basic food. Homeopaths use a dilute
            extract as a treatment for colds, but most other medical systems use it in a
            non-specific fashion as a warm, invigorating and satisfying tonic herb. It is sometimes
            used topically to treat insect stings, but personal experience suggests it lacks any
            significant anti-allergy properties. It has mild anti-microbial qualities and has been
            used in wound treatment.</h3>

        <h1>Analysis</h1>
        <h2>This website was created to expand upon and explore the knowledge of historic recipes
            used in the spice trade, as well as the most common spices used in those recipes.</h2>
        <h2> The spices:</h2>
        <ul style="list-style-type:square">
            <li>Black Pepper</li>
            <li>Cardamom</li>
            <li>Cinnamon</li>
            <li>Cilantro</li>
            <li>Cumin</li>
            <li>Garlic</li>
            <li>Ginger</li>
            <li>Nutmeg</li>
            <li>Onion</li>
            <li>Saffron</li>
            <li>Tumeric</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Each of these spices were broken down by their genus species, family, origin, and
            cultivation followed along with a brief description of why they are used and how they
            are used. Included in our findings is that these spices have family types in
            common.</h3>
        <h3>Three spices: </h3>
        <ul style="list-style-type:square">
            <li>Cardamom</li>
            <li>Turmeric</li>
            <li>Ginger</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Belong in the Zingiberaceae family.</h3>
        <h3>Two spices:</h3>
        <ul style="list-style-type:square">
            <li>Ginger</li>
            <li>Cumin</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Belong to the Apiaceae family.</h3>
        <h3>Then, the rest of the eleven spices belong to families of their own. This is interesting
            because, it represents the correlation between family of spice and the commonality
            within them. Taking a look at the SVG graph below we can see this in a simpler form: </h3>
        <h5>(insert sammy svg)</h5>
        <h3>As well as the number of family occurrences, we can also see that the spices differ in
            heat level using a heat index. </h3>
        <h3>We can see that the refence of heat goes from zero (being the lowest) to ten (being the
            highest). With that being said in order the spices go as follows:</h3>
        <ul style="list-style-type:square">
            <li>Ginger</li>
            <li>Black Pepper</li>
            <li>Garlic & Cumin</li>
            <li>Cinnamon & Tumeric</li>
            <li>Cardamom</li>
            <li>Nutmeg</li>
            <li>Saffron</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>This represents each indivdual spice's heat wich also reflects to thier location in the
            world and with which dishes they are used in</h3>
        <h5>(insert Bianka svg)</h5>
        <h3>Along with this data, we have also found that some of these eleven spices have similar
            origins. For example: </h3>
        <ul style="list-style-type:square">
            <li>Garlic</li>
            <li>Onion</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Both have origins in the Himilayas as well as Siberia.</h3>

        <h1>Ginger</h1>
        <h3>Common Name: Ginger</h3>
        <h3>Genus Species: Zingiber officinale</h3>
        <h3>Family: Zingiberaceae</h3>
        <h3>Origin: Tropical China</h3>
        <h3>Cultivation: India, China, Japan, Indonesia, Australia (Queensland); Sierra Leone,
            Nigeria; Jamaica and other West Indies islands</h3>
        <h3>Description: One of the most popular of the hot-tasting spices is ginger, which is
            obtained from the root of Zingiber officinale. The plant is indigenous to southern
            China, from whence it is spread to the Spice Islands and other parts of Asia, and
            subsequently to West Africa and to the Caribbean. India is now the main producer and
            exporter. Extracts of ginger are used in foods, condiments, baked confections, candies,
            beverages, cosmetics and perfumes. It is common to find it in many supermarkets for use
            in food preparation or as an herbal medicine. China produces a ginger which is
            particularly suited for confectionery, whereas Japanese ginger lacks the typical aroma.
            Pickled ginger (gari or sushoga) is always used as a condiment for sushi. Overall,
            ginger products vary considerably in taste, pungency and smell, while the root varies in
            consistency, depending on the country of origin and the variety of the crop</h3>

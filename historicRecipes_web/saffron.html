        <h3>Common Name: Saffron</h3>
        <h3>Genus Species: Crocus sativus</h3>
        <h3>Family: Iridaceae </h3>
        <h3>Origin: Near East, possibly Asian Minor</h3>
        <h3>Cultivation: Spain, Austria, Italy, Greece, France, Iran, Kashmir</h3>
        <h3>Description: The purple crocus, Crocus sativus, has long been cultivated in Asia Minor
            and in Spain so that its hand-picked stigmas can be used both as a spice and as a
            brilliant red-yellow dye. The plant is now cultivated in India, Iran and several
            Mediterranean countries; it used to be grown in the southern England town, Saffron
            Walden. The yellow color of paella, bouillabaise, saffron cakes, challah bread, and some
            curry sauces is characteristically obtained from saffron. Unlike the cheaper turmeric,
            it can penetrate into rice grains, and a small amount can impart its flavor and smell to
            the food. Currently, saffron is one of the most expensive spices because it requires
            labor-intensive harvesting. The medicinal uses of saffron in the past included its
            general employment as an antidote against poisoning, a digestant, an aphrodisiac, a
            tonic, and as a specific for dysentery and measles. In accordance with the Doctrine of
            Signatures, its yellow color signified its natural ability to treat jaundice.</h3>

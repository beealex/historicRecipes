        <h1>Turmeric</h1>
        <h3>Common Name: Tumeric</h3>
        <h3>Genus Species: Curcuma longa</h3>
        <h3>Family: Zingiberaceae</h3>
        <h3>Origin: Southern Asia</h3>
        <h3>Cultivation: India (especially the south central states), southern and eastern China,
            Taiwan, Philippines, Java, Haiti, Jamaica, Peru</h3>
        <h3>Description: The root of Curcuma longa is ground up to provide the yellow dye and flavor
            known as haldi in India and turmeric in the West. It is cultivated in several countries
            in south-eastern Asia, and is widely used as an appetite stimulant and digestive in
            various sauces, and as a rice colorant and a standard curry constituent, or as an
            inexpensive substitute for saffron. The spice has become more popular recently as a
            source of the yellow turmerone, curcumin: this is believed to have antioxidant,
            anti-inflammatory and anticholesterolemic properties. Herbalists advise that it be used
            to prevent heart disease and cancer, and to treat HIV infection and arthritis. In
            Chinese medicine, it is used to control hemorrhage, and to treat various diseases such
            as asthma and coryza. Curcumin is often added to food products as a colorant and to
            prevent their spoilage by oxidation. </h3>

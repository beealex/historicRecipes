        <h1>Black Pepper</h1>
        <h3>Common Name: Black Pepper</h3>
        <h3>Genus Species: Piper nigrum</h3>
        <h3>Family: Piperaceae</h3>
        <h3>Origin: India</h3>
        <h3>Cultivation: India, Indonesia, Brazil, Madagascar</h3>
        <h3>Description: Freshly ground pepper is more aromatic than packaged powders, and the
            ceremony of the waiter grinding the pepper over one’s entrée has some gustatory merit in
            addition to offering a ceremonial reminder of pepper’s ancient importance. Most black
            pepper comes from India, where it is known as the king of the spices; it is also
            exported from Indonesia, Malaysia and Brazil. It has always been one of the most popular
            spices, and the successful sea voyages of U.S. importers of pepper and cloves made
            Salem, Massachusetts, one of the richest towns in the U.S.A. at the beginning of the
            19th century. Black pepper is available on most Western dining tables, but yellow pepper
            is preferred in cooking since it does not add dark color to foods.</h3>

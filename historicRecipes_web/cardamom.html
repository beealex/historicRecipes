        <h3>Common Name: Cardamom</h3>
        <h3>Genus Species: Elettaria cardamomum</h3>
        <h3>Family: Zingiberaceae </h3>
        <h3>Origin: Near East and Ceylon (Sri Lanka)</h3>
        <h3>Cultivation: India, Ceylon (Sri Lanka), Cambodia, Guatemala, El Salvador</h3>
        <h3>Description: Several varieties of seed plants are known as cardamon, but the best known
            is an export from India, where it is obtained from a ginger-like plant, Elettaria
            cardamomum. It is related to black cardamom, and to melegueta (also known as grains of
            paradise), a peppery cardamon-like seed which grows mainly in West Africa; this was a
            popular European import in the Middle Ages and the Renaissance. Cardamom is particularly
            popular in Arab countries for flavoring coffee, and perhaps half the worldâ€™s production
            is thus used. Cardamom and related spices were used by the Romans, and it remains
            popular in baked products in Scandinavian and Baltic countries. The seeds are widely
            used in cooking and in chewing products (similar to chewing gum) in India and Pakistan,
            and in Persian cuisine, but it is not widely appreciated in North America as a cooking
            spice or as a flavor in candies or beverages. Its exotic qualities have suggested it
            could be used as a stimulant and aphrodisiac, and long ago it was used as a perfume and
            breath freshener.</h3>

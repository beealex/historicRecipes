            <li>2 large garlic cloves</li>
            <li>1/4 cup canola oil 60 mL</li>
            <li>1 cup tomato sauce 250 mL</li>
            <li>3 lbs cut-up bone-in chicken, skin removed (see Cook’s Tips)</li>
            <li>1 tsp coarse sea or kosher salt 5 mL</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Instructions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>In small bowl, combine cumin, cardamom, peppercorns, chiles and cinnamon. Preheat large skillet over medium-high heat. Once pan feels hot, add spice blend pan.</li>
            <li>Toast spices, stirring them constantly as they bloom with nutty aroma and turn just a shade darker, 1 to 2 minutes.</li>
            <li>Quickly remove spices from pan and transfer to plate to cool, about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Once cooled, transfer spices to grinder, like coffee grinder, and grind to consistency of finely ground black pepper.</li>
            <li>In food processor, place coarsely chopped onion, ginger, garlic and ground spices.</li>
            <li>Mince ingredients to consistency of slightly coarse paste.</li>
            <li>In same skillet, pour canola oil and heat over medium temperature. Once oil appears to shimmer, add finely chopped onion and stir-fry until it turns light brown around edges, about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add paste to same skilletand cook, stirring ingredients occasionally, uncovered, until moisture in paste evaporates and canola oil starts to separate from mix, 5 to 8 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add chicken pieces and allow them to absorb flavors from other ingredients, turning occasionally, uncovered, until some pieces turn lightly brown, about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Pour in tomato sauce, sprinkle in salt and stir well. </li>
            <li>Lower heat to medium-low and cook chicken, covered, stirring occasionally, until meat in thickest parts is no longer pink inside and juices run clear, 20 to 25 minutes.</li>
            <li>Serve chicken warm with aromatic sauce alongside a plate of rice, couscous or in the traditional way with slices of hard-boiled eggs.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Cook’s Tip: Cut-up, bone-in chicken can be found in every grocery store’s meat department. These skin-on pieces are easy to work with compared to the messy process of skinning a whole chicken and cutting it into smaller pieces. To skin, hold chicken piece in one hand and with a paper towel in the other hand, pull off skin, using towel to help you grip skin. Sometimes partially freezing chicken also makes skinning easier. While pre-cut pieces make for less work, they are typically more expensive than a whole chicken.</p>

(The website above includes great information on the different spices; origin, medicinal properties, where it was cultivated, description, historical view, genus name. However, the information is not presented extremely well. It is very simple, it does not have any images and it is not interactive. The timeline goes from 5,000 BC to the 1900s. This might be a great source of info that we could revamp)
